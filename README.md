# CS230-Portfolio
Portfolio for SNHU CS 230
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Gaming Room is a fictinal gaming company created for the purposes of this course. They develop and deploy games to digital platforms, such as their latest mobile release "Draw It or Lose It". Their intention was to port this game to a universal online platform accessible from a Web app, making it a cross-platform experience.
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    In particular, I believe in my analysis of operating platforms and the challenges associated with each, as well as geeric development considerations. Leveraging my experience in game development, I highlighted specific conerns that arise from online networked games where competitive fairness is integral to the experience.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    In particular, the pure act of building a design document helps the mind catch small technical details and avoid them during development. It also assists in generating a proper underlying structure for the resulting software, reducing refactoring and increasing efficiency.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    In particular, I would revise my application requirements analysis. Performed at an early stage of development, it would benefit from a second perspecive guided by new knowledge gained during the course.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The act of software design is about developing software to meet needs. Without knowing these needs from the client, the target is unknown. For this application, particularly the always-online nature of the game and the multi-platform operability informed decisions about server structure and oeprating platform.
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    Iteration is an important methodology in designing software - making changes incrementally such that if a feature or decision does not work out, it is not a significant resource loss to pivot. This allows the design to adapt when testing reveals usage issues or optimizations that can be made.
